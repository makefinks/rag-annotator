The adoption of real-time GPS tracking systems, integrated with both internal inventory management and external logistics provider platforms, enables more accurate monitoring of shipments and reduces the need for excessive buffer inventory. This, in turn, can free up valuable warehouse space and delay the need for costly expansions. However, implementing such systems requires significant investment in API integration and data infrastructure, as well as close collaboration with logistics partners. Additionally, optimizing warehouse layouts and inventory management software can further reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. It is essential to balance the benefits of stricter JIT protocols with the potential risks of line stoppages due to delayed deliveries.
