Furthermore, any significant infrastructure modifications, such as floor layout changes or the integration of new control systems, should be carefully planned to minimize disruption to ongoing production. The ultimate goal is to achieve a measurable reduction in cycle time and an increase in throughput, while maintaining or improving product quality and safety standards.

The adoption of real-time GPS tracking systems, integrated with both internal inventory management and external logistics provider platforms, enables more accurate monitoring of shipments and reduces the need for excessive buffer inventory. This, in turn, can free up valuable warehouse space and delay the need for costly expansions. However, implementing such systems requires significant investment in API integration and data infrastructure, as well as close collaboration with logistics partners. Additionally, optimizing warehouse layouts and inventory management software can further reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. It is essential to balance the benefits of stricter JIT protocols with the potential risks of line stoppages due to delayed deliveries. Continuous analysis of logistics costs, space utilization, and process bottlenecks is necessary to ensure that the supply chain remains agile and responsive to changing production demands."
